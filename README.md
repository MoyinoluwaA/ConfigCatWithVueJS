# ConfigCat with VueJS
## Application's Functionality:
On load of the app, you are provided a button that asks if you want to calculate your age. When clicked, it sends a status request to configCat for that feature. If the calculateUserAgeFeature flag is toggled on the configCat dashboard, the feature is enabled for use and an input field appears for a user to calculate their age based on birth year. But if the feature flag is toggled off, a message is displayed telling the user that the feature is currently disabled by the admin.
